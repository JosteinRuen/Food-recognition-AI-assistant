Computer Vision on Raspberry Pi

Introduction
The main purpose of this project is to utilize computer vision and a CNN on a Raspberry Pi to make the process of preparing meals easier. Due to the hardware limitations of the Raspberry Pi 4, the model is trained externally and imported over to the Pi, leading to less computational overhead when the aplication is running.

The project makes use of the Tensorflow library during the training process, and uses OpenCV for handling of the image recognition task
This project requires the use the following hardware:
* Raspberry Pi 4
* Raspberry Pi Camera module V2.1
